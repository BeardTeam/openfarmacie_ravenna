# OpenFarmacie@Ravenna

This web/mobile app uses some Open Data from Comune di Ravenna, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.  

Especially, all available informations about pharmacies are handled, in order to provide a rich form to search the nearest and open pharmacy, or which have certain services (as blood examination, oxygen tank, etc).  
  
    
    
This app was 2nd winner place at the Ra4Open Contest
